            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is a purposeful activity directed at achieving certain aims,
                such as transmitting knowledge or fostering skills and character traits. These aims may include the
                development of understanding, rationality, kindness, and honesty. Various researchers emphasize the role
                of critical thinking in order to distinguish education from indoctrination.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Some theorists require that education results in an improvement of the
                student while others prefer a value-neutral definition of the term. In a slightly different sense,
                education may also refer, not to the process, but to the product of this process: the mental states and
                dispositions possessed by educated people. Education originated as the transmission of cultural heritage
                from one generation to the next. Today, educational goals increasingly encompass new ideas such as the
                liberation of learners, skills needed for modern society, empathy, and complex vocational skills.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Types of education are commonly divided into formal, non-formal, and
                informal education. Formal education takes place in education and training institutions, is usually
                structured by curricular aims and objectives, and learning is typically guided by a teacher. In most
                regions, formal education is compulsory up to a certain age and commonly divided into educational stages
                such as kindergarten, primary school and secondary school. Nonformal education occurs as addition or
                alternative to formal education.</p>
